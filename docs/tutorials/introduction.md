# Introduction to LangGraph Evolution

LangGraph Evolution is a system for building, managing, and executing directed graph workflows for language model applications. It allows you to create complex workflows with multiple agents, state management, and message passing in a robust and scalable way.

## Core Concepts

### Workflows

A workflow in LangGraph Evolution is a directed graph of nodes, where each node represents a processing step or agent. Workflows define how data flows through your application and how different components interact.

Key characteristics of workflows include:
- **Directed**: Data flows in one direction through the graph
- **Stateful**: Maintains state throughout execution
- **Composable**: Can be built from smaller workflow components
- **Configurable**: Can be customized for different use cases

### Agents

Agents are specialized nodes in a workflow that perform specific tasks. They can:
- Process input data
- Generate responses
- Make decisions
- Call external tools
- Manage state transformations

LangGraph Evolution provides several built-in agent types and allows you to create custom agents for your specific needs.

### State Management

State management is a core feature of LangGraph Evolution. The system:
- Maintains consistent state across the workflow
- Provides mechanisms for state updates and transformations
- Ensures safe state access across concurrent operations
- Supports typed state definitions for better reliability

### Message Passing

Communication between nodes happens through a message passing system:
- Messages follow the edges of the workflow graph
- Each message has a specific format and purpose
- Messages can carry data, instructions, or control information
- The system handles routing and delivery of messages

## System Architecture

LangGraph Evolution is built on several key components:

1. **Core**: Fundamental classes and utilities for workflow definition and execution
2. **Runtime**: Execution engine that processes workflows
3. **Agents**: Specialized components that perform tasks within workflows
4. **State Management**: Tools for managing state across workflow execution

## When to Use LangGraph Evolution

LangGraph Evolution is particularly useful for:

- **Complex LLM Orchestration**: Managing multiple LLM calls with interdependencies
- **Multi-Agent Systems**: Coordinating multiple specialized agents
- **Stateful Applications**: Applications that need to maintain complex state
- **Decision Workflows**: Systems that require decision-making and branching logic
- **Scalable AI Systems**: Building systems that can scale with increasing complexity
